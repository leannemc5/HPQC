# Overview of Week 2 activities:
Each activity studied how long it takes C and Python programs to run using differnt operations including simple print statments, loops and I/O file.
This was done using the time command for external benchmarking and time_print programs for internal benchmarking.

## Instructions
### Activity 1:
The first activity was to become fimiliar with the built-in time command called time. 
This was done by timing the command ls: time ls

### Activity 2:
The next activity involved timing how long it takes to run a simple 'Hello World' C and Python programs.
After cloning the class materials to my repo, in the home directory a bin file was created to run the files.
Next the C programm was compiled using:                                                       
```gcc week2/hello_world.c -o bin/hello_world```                                                                  
From this both programs can be ran using:
```
time python3 week2/hello_world.py 
time ./bin/hello_world
```

The process was repeated but for 'Repeat Adder' program. This code is just a long winded way of multiplying 2 numbers; m and n; by constantly adding m to itself n times.
The C program was compiled using gcc ```week2/repeat_adder.c -o bin/repeat_adder```.
Using the same commands from earlier, the times for the programs to be ran can be found.
``` 
time python3 week2/repeat_adder.py n m
time ./bin/repeat_adder n m
```

Note: Both programs had to be edited before being able to run them. 
The given code had a mixed of space and tab intents which cheetah did not like which had to be manually fixed before complinging each program.

### Activity 3:
This activities focus was on indtroducing internal benchmarking. A sample code in python and C called *'time_print'* were provided in the class repo with the internal timing code already included.
Similarily to previous steps, the C code was compiled via ```gcc week2/time_print.c -o bin/time_print```.
Both codes were then using various different inputs to test how long it takes to run the code in each language.
```
./bin/time_print 50000
python3 week2/time_print.py 50000

```
### Activity 4: 
The last excersice wished for us to take the provided C and Python templates in this weeks repo and use them as a guide to input I/O to see how long it takes to read and write to a file.
Two codes were made, with one focusing on timing how long it took to write to a file, and the other focused on how long it took to read from a file.

#### Writing to a file:


## Results:

### Part 1:
real 0m0.006s                     
user 0m0.000s                            
sys 0m0.005s                           

### Part 2:
#### Python script:                                   
Hello World!                   
real    0.035s                 
user    0.023s              
sys     0.008s     

#### C script:   
Hello World!                             
real    0.006s                   
user    0.000s                
sys     0.004s
